# lc_improved
A improved version of a simple program I made that counts lines in a file

NEW:
added a -h for instruction in the program. Removed the default to stdin when no file input requires the -s flag to use stdin in instances when you want to pipe something into the program. 
Plan on adding more functionailty to the program like excluding code commments.
